# 🧠 CPU Scheduling Simulator – Java Console Project

A console-based Java application that simulates various **CPU scheduling algorithms**, helping users understand how different schedulers manage processes.

---

## 📌 Features

- Simulates core scheduling algorithms:
  - ✅ First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - ✅ Round Robin
  - ✅ Preemptive Priority
  - ✅ Non-Preemptive Priority
- Console-based interface
- Calculates:
  - Average waiting time
  - Turnaround time
  - Execution order

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java (Console Application)
- NetBeans IDE (or any Java IDE)
- Object-Oriented Programming

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Project

1. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., NetBeans or IntelliJ)
2. Navigate to the `SchedulerMain` class
3. Run the project (It will launch in the console)
4. Follow the prompts to input process details and see the scheduling result
